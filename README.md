## 1. Project Overview

This repository contains the completed term project for **COMP 1320: Introduction to Software Development**.  
The project involves building a functional JavaScript-based application titled **BCITips**, designed to demonstrate foundational programming concepts including algorithmic thinking, modular design, event handling, user input validation, and DOM manipulation.

The purpose of this assignment is to apply theoretical course concepts to a practical, interactive solution that accurately processes user input and delivers validated outcomes following the assignment’s specification guidelines.

## 2. Learning Objectives Demonstrated

This project fulfills the following COMP 1320 learning outcomes:

- **Problem decomposition** using functions and reusable logic.  
- **Implementation of control structures:** conditionals, loops, and user-driven interaction.  
- **DOM manipulation** to update interface elements based on program logic.  
- **Validation strategies** ensuring correct user input and error handling.  
- **Clean, readable, and maintainable code** following best practices.  
- **Use of version control (Git/GitHub)** for source management.  
- **Testing and verification** through manual and video-based validation.

## 3. Features Implemented

The BCITips application includes:

- A structured HTML/CSS interface supporting user interaction  
- Responsive input fields and buttons triggering program logic  
- Full validation of inputs according to assignment requirements  
- Clear error messaging for invalid data  
- Modular JavaScript functions supporting maintainability  
- Dynamic content updates displayed through DOM manipulation  
- Comprehensive validation walkthrough (YouTube video link provided)

## 5. Validation Demonstration (Video)

Due to GitHub’s maximum file size limit of 100 MB, the full validation walkthrough video has been uploaded to YouTube.

▶ **Validation Video Link:**

This video demonstrates:

- Each validation step performing as expected  
- Correct handling of valid and invalid test cases  
- Expected output based on assignment specifications
